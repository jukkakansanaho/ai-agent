# AI Agent
AI Agent is a guided Boot.dev project. 
If you've ever used [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en) or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) as an "[agentic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI)" AI editor, you'll understand what we're building in this project.

We're building a toy version of Claude Code using Google's [free Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)!
